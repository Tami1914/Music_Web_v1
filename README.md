# Music Web

Music Blog to Stay Updated on Music News and Not Miss Any of the Great Hits.

## Getting Started

The website consists of 3 articles related to music and an image gallery. In the header, there is a dropdown menu to navigate through the page. One of the links, called 'reference,' takes you to the reference page. In the first article, you can find a list of the most listened songs with a link to them. The rest of the articles are news related to music.
